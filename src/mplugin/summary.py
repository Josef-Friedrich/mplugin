"""Create status line from results.

This module contains the :class:`Summary` class which serves as base
class to get a status line from the check's :class:`~.result.Results`. A
Summary object is used by :class:`~.check.Check` to obtain a suitable data
:term:`presentation` depending on the check's overall state.

Plugin authors may either stick to the default implementation or subclass it
to adapt it to the check's domain. The status line is probably the most
important piece of text returned from a check: It must lead directly to the
problem in the most concise way. So while the default implementation is quite
usable, plugin authors should consider subclassing to provide a specific
implementation that gets the output to the point.
